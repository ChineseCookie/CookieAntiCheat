## HitBox
# Description: This check prevents players from using HitBox, Angle, Reach hacks.
# Note: This check is strict ONLY when you attack other PLAYERS, but it's very loose
# when you attack non-player creatures. So, if you find that you can use HixBox
# hack on non-player creatures, it's very normal, don't report it.

  # How many moves should the Matrix trace back to the player? (default: 7)
  # You can set this higher to reduce false positives, but this will weaken HitBox detection
  # My suggestion is 3 to 10, please don't make it more than 10, because it is useless
  trace_back_length: 7

  # How much should Matrix ignore players with greater network latency?
  # When the player's network latency is greater than this value, some

  # Whether Matrix should cancel the player's attack after detecting the player's cheating?
